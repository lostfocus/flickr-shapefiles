The Flickr Shapefile Public Dataset 2.0.

## What is this?

A few years ago Flickr used their geotagged photos to compute shapefiles for each neighbourhood and city they had in their [GeoPlanet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoPlanet) database. They were nice enough to publish those shapefiles in [huge GeoJSON files](http://code.flickr.net/2011/01/08/flickr-shapefiles-public-dataset-2-0/) and put a very nice CC0 licence on it.  
I picked those huge GeoJSON files apart using [geojsplit](https://github.com/woodb/geojsplit) and sorted them by their WoEID.  
And because I figured someone else might find that useful, too, I decided to upload the whole thing to Github. Enjoy.
